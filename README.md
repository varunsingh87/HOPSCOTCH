# Penn Apps 2022 Fall Project

Musathon, hackathons for composing and music cover competitions.
Created in react, using Convex as a backend.

Use `ConvexError` for user errors to specify the error message and use `Error` for developer errors.
`ConvexError` takes an object literal for its constructor and the `Error` object takes an object literal
as its second parameter with specific properties.
